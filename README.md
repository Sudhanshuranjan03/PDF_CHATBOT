Intelligent PDF Query Chatbot

The Intelligent PDF Query Chatbot is a sophisticated AI application designed to interactively respond to user queries based on the content of uploaded PDF documents. The primary objective of this project is to provide a seamless and efficient way to extract and understand information from PDFs through natural language queries, making document navigation and information retrieval highly user-friendly.

RAG :
  The RAG technique employed involves extracting text from PDFs, converting the text into manageable chunks, generating embeddings for these chunks, and storing them in a vector database. Upon user query, the system retrieves relevant chunks using semantic search and generates responses using the LLM.
